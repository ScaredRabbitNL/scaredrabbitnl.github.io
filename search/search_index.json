That is because as of version 1.3.4-1.20.4, the mod will be called Reworked Netherite. This is because I want to turn this mod into a bigger mod than it currently is. A name like SimpleNetherite wouldn't fit to the contents of the mod. Also, as of minecraft version 1.20.4, Forge support will be dropped in favour of NeoForge. This is because the current state that Forge has, is not very stable and updates are very slow. Later versions will not be supported on Forge.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/18/slight-revise-of-the-wikis-main-page/","title":"Slight revise of the wiki's main page","text":"<p>I have added some content on why I made this page and cleaned up some things.
