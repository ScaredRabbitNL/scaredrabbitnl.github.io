# SimpleNetherite Rebrand & Recent changes

As some might have noticed on the CurseForge & GitHub pages, I have archived some projects. That is because as of version 1.3.x-1.20.x, the mod will be called **Reworked Netherite**. This is because I want to turn this mod into a bigger mod that it currently is. A name like **Simple**Netherite wouldn't fit to the contents of the mod. Also, as of minecraft version 1.20.4, **Forge support will be dropped in favour of NeoForge**. This is because the current state that Forge has, is not very stable and updates are very slow. **Later versions will not be supported on Forge.**
